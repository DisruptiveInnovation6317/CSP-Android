# Contributing
When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue,
email, or any other method with the owners of this repository before making a change.

## Pull Request Process
1. To start making changes, first make a fork of the repository and create your new branch. If you already have a fork of the app, *please* make sure you pull from this origin to receive the most up-to-date version. Your new branch should branch off of the `feature` branch, and be named in the scheme `feature-xx`, where `xx` is a short name of your change. For example,
    - If adding QR aggregator capability to the app, the branch could be named `feature-qraggregator`
    - If adding pit scouting, the branch could be named `feature-pitscout`
2. When you believe your changes are completed, merge your branch into feature. Remember, these changes are still occuring on **your** fork. Test the app and make sure it plays well with the feature branch. Try to find bugs you may have created. If you do find them, switch back to your custom feature branch, squash them, and merge back into feature again.
**Note**: if you are fixing an issue on the [Issues](https://github.com/DisruptiveInnovation6317/CSP-Android/issues) page, you can include “Closes #`x`”, where `x` is the issue number you’re closing, in your commit message. This will allow the issue in our project issue tracking to automatically close. Although not necessary, it is definitely helpful to remember this.
3. Now you can create a pull request to the feature branch of this repository. In the description, please write what the major changes are of your contribution. 
4. Allow for one of the lead developers of the project to merge the pull request.
