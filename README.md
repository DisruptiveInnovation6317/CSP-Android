    <h1>FRC Scouting App</h1>
    <p>This app is a collaborative effort between FRC teams <a href="https://www.projectb.net.au/">#5985</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/West_INSPIRE">#6317</a></p>
    <p>This application will be used to scout during tournaments that usually require multiple team members to venture beyond their team and record the progress of other teams. One of the app's purposes is to compile the information from teams into one database, making it easier to scout other teams without having to visit all of them.</p>
    <h2>Releases</2>
    <p>We periodically release precompiled .apk files for install on our <a href="https://github.com/DisruptiveInnovation6317/CSP-Android/releases">Releases page</a>. Please notice that we also post betas, so if you want a stable version we recommend grabbing the latest stable release.</p>
